# MRHS solver implementation
We are a group of developers engaged in the development of MRHS equations and its distribution. In this project, we want to expand the libraries that deal with this issue with our research.

## Usage 


---

#### MRHS_Solver.CTypes

- [**CTypeMRHS**](CTypeMRHS.md) 
  - Wrapper class for C interactions

- [**SolverReport**](SolverReport.md)
  - Solver report class for C implementation 
  
- [*Structs*](CStructs.md)

- [*LoadFIle*](LoadFIle.md)
  - Functions to handle input file and transform it to MRHS form

### Function collections

---

#### MRHS_Solver

- [**EchelonMRHS**](EchelonMRHS.md)
  - Collection of functions for creating echelon form of MRHS

- [**SolveMRHS**](SolveMRHS.md)
  - Collection of functions for solving MRHS

- [**CreateFile**](CreateFile.md)
  - Collection of functions for writing MRHS into a text file
